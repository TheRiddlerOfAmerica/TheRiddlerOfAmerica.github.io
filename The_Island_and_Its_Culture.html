        <h1>The Island and Its Culture</h1>
        <p>This island, while residing within the world of dungeons and dragons, is isolated and contains advanced technology. Some may ask why I decided to set this Cthulhu themed campaign inside Dungeons and Dragons, and the reason is twofold. First, DnD was the easiest system for my players who already knew the rules. Second, the point of a cthulhu story is to encounter that which is beyond the scale of their world. Players who come into this campaign with the idea of DnD will find their skills and abilities lacking, they will need to adapt to the ways of this island in order to gain the power to survive.</p>

        <h1>Isolation</h1>
        <p>This island is intensely isolated, but how does it stay isolated. The first natural defense of this island is it's thick fog shroud. From the island shore, fog stretches 20 miles in every direction. The fog itself tends to wear away at navigational equiptment at an alarming rate. A normal compass can survive mere minutes in the fog before locking up and refusing to spin. This makes the island difficult to spot, even on the clearest of days, and difficult to navigate to, even with the best of equipment. Rain is also common, accounting for 4 out of every 5 days, with every day without rain being dulled by the fog. Sunshine is a rarity on this island, and should be treated as such.</p>

        <h1>The Island Layout</h1>
        <p>The island itself is made up of two primary areas, the forest of Oakmont and the city of Oakmont. The forest lies to the north, whereas the city subsumes the entire south section of the island.</p>

    <div class="centermid">
        <h1>The Island Surroundings</h1>
        <p>Within the fog lie a myriad of mysterious places. To the north lie the snake crags, an area of sea which has stone spires jutting from the ocean, snaking their way high into the sky before submerging back under the sea. To the East lies a deep crevasse beneath the water, unexplored by mortal men. To the South lie a dangerous den of sea monsters. To the West the water grows dark, as if you were on the bottom of the ocean floor mere inches above the water.</p>

        <h1>The Murky Depths</h1>
        <p>Very few know why, but the waters within the mist of oakmont are toxic. The property is not magical, but when consumed the water will slowly eat away at the persons insides. Thankfully boiling the water seems to remedy this malady. However, even if you were to cast water breathing, this effect would still ravage the person if they tried to breath Oakmonts sea water. This has led to the creation of the Carpenter Diving Suits.</p>

        <h1>The People</h1>
        <br />
        <h2>Law Enforcement</h2>
        <img class="center" src="Placeholder.jpg" />
        <p>The Blackwoods fund and control the police force. Common officers are equipped with easy to use and highly leathal firearms. Oakmont is relatively peaceful, any fighting that may occur tends to be quick and away from the public eye. The main concern of officers tends to be focused on the organized crime of the city. Be it the Fleecers, the Rats, or the Doom Squad. Though recently the police have found a serial killer is on the loose.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>The Workers</h2>
        <img class="center" src="Placeholder.jpg" />
        <p>The Carpenters employ almost all of the islands factory workers and craftsmen. The workers of Oakmont vary greatly, primarily composed of Triton and Human people, over the years all sorts of races have found their way to the island through the Carpenters trade with cities across the sea. Most people who grew up on the island can tell if someone is new to the island. It's the smell, their clothes just don't have the years of factory smoke and sea salt ground into them yet.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>The Intellectuals and Creatives</h2>
        <img class="center" src="Placeholder.jpg" />
        <p>The Throgmortons find and raise up talented scholars and artists within the city.</p>
        <br/>
        <h2>The Blackwoods</h2>
        <img class="center" src="Placeholder.jpg" />
        <p>The blackwoods were the first group to set foot on the island of oakmont. They are Tritons who have adapted to life outside the toxic waters of oakmont. They can no longer breath underwater, and prefer normal clothing. They have become the political body of oakmont, and oversee the various fishing companies on the island. They are skilled at navigating through the fog of Oakmont. Blackwood Navigators tend to use their Triton communication and a companion fish to navigate through the fog. Blackwoods tend to focus on working with what they have rather than building something new.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>The Carpenters</h2>
        <img class="center" src="Placeholder.jpg" />
        <p>The Carpenters arrived on the island one hundred years after the blackwoods first arrived. With them they brought an immense work force. The Carpenters dominate the production and trade within the city. In only a few years they turned the city from a fishing village into a proper city. As their name suggests they constructed 95% of the homes currently on the island. They are also in charge of the produciton of refined metals, armor, weaponry, everyday tools and light magical tools such as healing potions. The Carpenters sell much of the goods produced to cities outside of the island, trading for raw materials and rare treasures, and occasionally picking up those who wish to travel to Oakmont. Carpenters would rather fight to the death than let you steal from them, and they always remember debts.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>The Throgmortons</h2>
        <img class="center" src="Placeholder.jpg" />
        <p>The Throgmortons arrived on the island two hundred years after the Blackwoods first arrived. With them they brought ideas, culture, and curiosity. The Throgmortons sold many of their ideas to the Carpenters, those capable of giving their thoughts physical form. The island soon became an advanced place, filled with unseen technologies in the world. Electricity illuminated the streets, Theatre and Orchestra became a common sight to even the destitute of the city, and for a time criminals hid from the police and their firearms. Throgmortons seek new knowledge and have no qualms spreading this knowledge, for the right price.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>The Party</h2>
        <img class="center" src="Placeholder.jpg" />
        <p>The Party arrived on the island three hundred years after the Blackwoods first arrived. What will they bring with them?</p>
